# PasteTyper

PasteTyper is a simple Java program that simulates typing by pasting text character by character with random delays and occasional deletion of characters.

### Setup

1. **Download the .jar file:**
   You can download PasteTyper.jar from the repository
2. **Run the program:**
   Once downloaded, you can run the program using the following command:
   ```
   java -jar PasteTyper.jar
   ```
   **Note:** Make sure you are in the correct directory. To bypass this, just drag the file into your cmd prompt in place of `PasteTyper.jar`

### Usage

1. Enter the text you want to paste when prompted. (For new lines use \n and for tabs use \t)
2. Enter a typing speed. 10 is recommended. The higher the number the slower it will type. 
3. Click on your document after pressing enter in the command prompt
4. After 5 seconds, the program will simulate typing the text with random delays and occasional character deletions.

### Disclaimer
**This program requires Java to be installed on your system.**
