# PasteTyper

PasteTyper is a simple Java program that simulates typing by pasting text character by character with random delays and occasional deletion of characters.

## Disclaimer
**This program requires Java 17 or up to be installed on your system<br>Java Download Link -->** https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/

## Setup

If on macOS, before starting, go to System Settings > Privacy and Security > Accessibility and then add and allow `Terminal` to the list (This gives the program its ability to type on your computer)

1. **Download the PasteTyper.jar file:**<br>You can download .jar from the repository
2. **Put file into folder:**<br>Make a new folder on your computer and put the `PasteTyper.jar` file into it.
3. **Get into the folder directory:**<br>Open your command prompt/terminal and type:
   ```
   cd (folder directory)
   ```
   The `(folder directory)` should be replaced by your folders directory. Simply drag your folder into the command prompt/terminal window.
4. **Run the program:**<br>Once downloaded, you can run the program using the following command:
   ```
   java -jar PasteTyper.jar
   ```

## Usage<br>

1. Answer Code Mode prompt accordingly. (What is [Code Mode](#code-mode)?)
2. Press 'Open File' and a file will be created in the folder you made called `text.txt`. It should auto-open, if not, just do it manually. Paste your text into this file. **SAVE THE TEXT FILE EDITS** (file > save)
3. Click where you want it to type after pressing 'Start Typing'
4. After 5 seconds, the program will simulate typing the text with random delays and occasional character deletions.


### Code Mode
This feature is for using PasteTyper with IDEs or other coding software. Only enable this feature if your coding environment has auto-indenting. This setting will allow for proper formatting while coding as well as make the typing more realistic. Otherwise, leave this feature off.
